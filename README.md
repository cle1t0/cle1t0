### Welcome, I am Thiago Nishimura  :coffee:
I am an undergrad student who loves programming.
As a student research assistant I am always amazed by the various ways technology can positively impact people's lives!
More recently, I have been working with informatics within the medical field. I am currently part of a team responsible for collaborating with physicians in studies that involve data and Machine Learning

Reach out! :smiley:
